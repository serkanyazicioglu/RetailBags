# Retail Bags Addon

Simple addon which adds a search input and a sort button on backpack on top of original WoW UI.

Adds crafting reagent text to crafting reagent and sell price to reagent and item tooltips.

Adds quality and item level to weapon and armor tooltips.

By using the native UI, it doesn't break experience with other addons like ConsolePort.
