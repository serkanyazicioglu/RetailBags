* Simple addon which adds search and sort functionalities on backpack on top of original WoW UI.

* Adds 'Crafting Reagent' and 'Max Stack' labels to reagent tooltips.

* Adds sell price to tooltips.

* Adds quality and item level labels to weapon and armor tooltips.

* By using the native UI, it doesn't break experience with other addons like ConsolePort.

* Displays item quality borders on bags, bank and inventory.

* Ability to open all bags automatically when character pane shows up. (Useful for handhelds and controllers).

* Ability to scale bag container size independently from the UI scale.
