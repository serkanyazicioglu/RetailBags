# Retail Bags Addon

* Simple addon which adds search and sort functionalities to backpack on top of original WoW UI.

* Adds 'Crafting Reagent' and 'Max Stack' labels to reagent tooltips.

* Adds sell price to tooltips.

* Adds quality and item level labels to weapon and armor tooltips.

* Displays item quality borders on bags, bank, inventory and merchant panes.

* Ability to open all bags and/or keyring automatically when character or auction pane shows up. (Useful for handhelds and controllers).

* Ability to scale bag container size independently from the UI scale.

* By using the native UI, it doesn't break experience with other addons like ConsolePort.
